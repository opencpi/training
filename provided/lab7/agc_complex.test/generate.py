AGC Complex: Generate test input data (binary data file).

Generate args:
- amount to generate (number of complex signed 16-bit samples)
- target file

To test the AGC Complex component, a binary data file is generated containing
complex signed 16-bit samples with a tone at Fs/16 where the first 1/4 of the
file is at 20% max amplitude, the second 1/4 of the file at 90% max amplitude,
the third 1/4 of the file at 20% max amplitude, and the last 1/4 of the file at
30% max amplitude. The output file is also a binary file containing complex
signed 16-bit samples where the amplitude has been smoothed by the AGC circuit
to the REF amplitude property setting and the tone is still present and of
sufficient power. The input file produced during the generate phase is also fed
to the validation phase where a python implementation of the agc is compared to
the UUT output.
