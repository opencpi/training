Complex Mixer: Generate test input data & Validate output data

Generate args:
1. sample frequency of generated sinusoid in Hz
2. center frequency of generated sinusoid in Hz
3. amplitude of generated sinusoid
4. number of complex samples to generated
5. output file

To test the Complex Mixer, a binary data file is generated containing complex
signed 16-bit samples with a tone at a configurable center frequency and sample
frequency. 

The Application XML sets the phase increment of the Mixer/NCO to output a 1 Hz tone,
sampled at 16 Hz. The output waveform's frequency is expected to +1 Hz greater than
the input waveform frequency. The validation of the test involves performing an FFT
of the output file to ensure the max tone is located at DC or 0 Hz.
