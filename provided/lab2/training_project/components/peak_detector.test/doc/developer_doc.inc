\section*{Functionality}
\begin{flushleft}
The {\Comp} worker utilizes the OCPI \textit{iqstream\_protocol} for both input and output ports. The \textit{iqstream\_protocol} defines an interface of 16-bit complex signed samples. The worker calculates the maximum and minimum peaks of the I/Q data arriving at its input port, and passes the input data through to the output port.
\newline

The {\Comp} worker uses two local variables to keep track of the maximum and minimum peak amplitudes. To ensure the peaks are detected correctly, the variable used to keep track of the maximum peak is initialized to the most negative value represented in a signed 16-bit number (-32768), and the minimum peak is initialized to the most positive value represented in a signed 16-bit number (32767). \newline

Upon completion, the {\Comp} returns the most positive I or Q sample value with the \verb+max_peak+ property and the most negative with the \verb+min_peak+ property. \textit{This is not the value of the vector represented by I and Q, but simply the max/min value of the I and Q samples taken independently.}\newline

\section*{Test and Verification}
\begin{flushleft}
A single test case is implemented to validate the {\comp} component. An input file is generated (via \textit{generate.py}) containing complex signed 16-bit samples with a tone at 13 Hz. The input data is passed through the worker, so the output file should be identical to the input file. The worker measures the minimum and maximum amplitudes found within the complex data stream. These values, reported as properties, are compared with min/max calculations performed during verification (\textit{verify.py}).

\newpage
\begin{flushleft}
The output file is first checked that the data is not all zero, and is then checked for the expected length of 32,768 complex samples. Once these quick checks are made the minimum and maximum values are calculated from the file and then compared with the UUT reported values. Figures \ref{fig:out_time_tone} and \ref{fig:out_freq_tone} depict the output of the {\Comp} worker, where the time domain plot displays the first 200 complex samples.
